//Task 1: Perform Basic Mathematical Operations
Problem Statement: Write a Python program that does the following:
1.  Takes two numbers as input from the user.
2.  Performs the basic mathematical operations on these two numbers:
o	Addition
o	Subtraction
o	Multiplication
o	Division
3.  Displays the results of each operation on the screen.//


Task 1: Functionality Description

This program asks the user to enter two numerical values. After taking the inputs, it performs four basic mathematical operations on these numbers:

Addition (adds both numbers)

Subtraction (subtracts the second number from the first)

Multiplication (multiplies both numbers)

Division (divides the first number by the second)

Finally, it displays the result of each operation on the screen.


Task 2: Create a Personalized Greeting
Problem Statement: Write a Python program that:
1.  Takes a user's first name and last name as input.
2.  Concatenates the first name and last name into a full name.
3.  Prints a personalized greeting message using the full name.

 Task 2: Functionality Description

This program prompts the user to enter their first name and last name separately. After receiving both inputs, the program joins the two names together to form the user's full name. Once the full name is created, the program displays a personalized greeting message on the screen using that full name. This makes the output feel more interactive and friendly, as it addresses the user directly by their complete name.
